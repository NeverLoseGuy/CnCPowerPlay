Your goal is simple: create an army to defend your building and destroy the enemies, while prevent them from doing the same.
Don't think this is an easy task though, as you will find yourself with up to 40 different units to choose from, each belonging to one of the five factions in the game. and each having its own quirks and abilities that if used correctly, could turn the tide of the battle, and even bring you the hard-earned victory.
