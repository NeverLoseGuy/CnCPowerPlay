# Command and Conquer: Power Play
Your goal is simple: create an army to defend your building and destroy the enemies, while prevent them from doing the same.
Don't think this is an easy task though, as you will find yourself with up to 40 different units to choose from, each belonging to one of the five factions in the game. and each having its own quirks and abilities that if used correctly, could turn the tide of the battle, and even bring you the hard-earned victory.

## What is this place?
This is the place where I put all the completed (both latest and older) builds. If you are looking for those, you can also find them here.

## I want to help and contribute!
If you want to make any changes to the build, feel free to download the completed builds and make changes. You can then either keep it as an alternate version in a fork repository, or pull request if you think it should be "officially" adopted into the main branch.
